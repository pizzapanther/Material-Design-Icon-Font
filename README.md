# Material Design Icon Font packaged for deployment

This is just the Material Design Icon Font packaged for deployment.  The original package contains all the development files which take up a lot of space.

This is ideal for Chrome Apps, Progressive Web Apps, or Native and hybrid iOS and Android apps that need offline access to the font.

The original package is here: https://github.com/google/material-design-icons

I'll try to keep it in sync but ping me if it needs to be updated.
